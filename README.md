Welcome to my Bellabeat Capstone Project, part of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate!

The Bellabeat Capstone Project involved a comprehensive analysis of smart device usage data to develop actionable insights that could enhance Bellabeat's product offerings and marketing strategies. The primary goal of the project was to leverage data analysis techniques to understand user behavior, identify trends in physical activity, sleep, heart rate, and weight tracking, and provide recommendations for optimizing Bellabeat's health and wellness products. By examining large datasets through tools such as R Studio, the project aimed to offer data-driven solutions that could drive customer engagement and boost overall product effectiveness. The insights derived from this analysis were intended to support Bellabeat in making informed decisions that align with the company's mission to empower women with data-driven health insights.
